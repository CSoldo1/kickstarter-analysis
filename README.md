## Overview
An up-and-coming playwrite asked me to help her plan a successful fundraisng campaign. By organizng, sorting, and analyzing data from thousands of Kickstarter campaigns  all over the world, I was able to identfy trends and give her valuable insight on the goal and timing of her campaign. 

### Factors Influencing Fundrasing Campaign Success

![Success Based on Category]

The success of Kickstarter campaigns is highly variable. About half of all theater-based fundraising campaigns are successful.

The above figure shows the results of theater-based Kickstarter campaigns that launched througout the year. 
A higher proportion of theater campaigns are successful when they are launched in the summer, as opposed to other times of the year. 


A campaign's success was also determined by the fundraising goal. Successful campaigns had an average goal of $5,000 while failed campaigns had a goal of $10,000. 

Based on the analyses briefly outlined above, I would recommend that the playwrite begin her fundraising campaign in June, and she should try to limit her budget to $5,000.
